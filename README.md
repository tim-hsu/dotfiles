My personal dotfiles

## External packages
The dotfiles are only a part of the configuration and the whole customized user experience. The following packages may need to be installed for the configuration to work well:

* In general
    * `miniconda`
    * `julia`
    * `fd`
    * `fzf`
    * Fonts: Inconsolata, Iosevka
* For `vim` or `neovim`
    * The `vim-instant-markdown` plugin needs [additional installation steps](https://github.com/suan/vim-instant-markdown)
* For `ranger` image preview
    * `w3m`
